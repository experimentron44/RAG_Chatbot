				NIST believes in motivating the students to carry out hands-on training along with regular class room
				coaching. Studies show that students learn best when the process is active, when they are engaged in
				hands-on classroom games and activities, and involved in what they are learning.
				
				Hands-on activities rekindle a love of learning and connect abstract concepts to the world -- while
				achieving desired educational outcomes. Hands-on instruction has a long and successful legacy in the
				sciences and mathematics.
			

				A NISTian research group is a well-knit thinking micro-community obsessed with a specialization. The
				underlying philosophy being ten thinking heads are better than one. Research and development plays a
				critical role in the innovation process. It's essentially an investment in technology and future
				capabilities which is transformed into new products, processes, and services.
				
				In industry and technology sectors, R&D is a crucial component of innovation and a key factor in
				developing new competitive advantages. NIST has several groups across all fields devoting themselves to
				research and bringing out innovative ideas.
			

				At NIST, we recognize the central role of education, sports and culture in its vision for the social and
				economic development. Education in the 21st century increasingly recognizes the role of values and
				social skills in tackling global challenges such as inactivity, obesity, unemployment, and conflict.
				
				Sports can teach values such as fairness, team-building, equality, discipline, inclusion, perseverance,
				and respect. Sports has the power to provide a universal framework for learning values, thus
				contributing to the development of soft skills needed for responsible citizenship.
			

				Giving other engineering institutions in Odisha a run for their money, the Berhampur-based National
				Institute of Science and Technology University forges ahead in the field of techno-education.
				
				Relentless efforts by the institution help it make forays into the big league of technical educational
				institutions in Odisha, besides retaining its strong foothold as one of the best engineering colleges in
				the state.
			

				Integration of work and study is the key element at NIST. Here, all the students are obliged to gain
				practical experience in the course of their academic education. The concept of clubs is seen as an
				opportunity for adaptation to life in the group, forming good life-long habits and cultivating a
				voluntaristic spirit.
				
				Club activities supplement academics and give the students practical training which they require in day
				to day life. At NIST, various club activities are organized for the students to display their talent.
